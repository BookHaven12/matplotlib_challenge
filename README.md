# matplotlib_challenge

### **Summary**
For this project, I analyzed datasets from a cancer drug study using Python and various data analysis tools. Key skills demonstrated include:

- **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Utilized pandas to merge, clean, filter, and aggregate data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib, including bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, and line graphs, to highlight key trends and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed calculations such as correlation coefficients, linear regression models, and Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis to interpret tumor response and identify potential outliers.
- **Critical Thinking**: Compared the effectiveness of cancer drugs using statistical measures and visual analysis, drawing conclusions about consistency, trends, and overall drug performance.

This assignment showcases my ability to process complex data, perform statistical analysis, and communicate findings effectively through clear and visually engaging charts.

### Resources Used:
I worked with Angel during a tutor session on the code for my graphs,
Xpert learning assistant to review concepts,
used code from class examples specifically for quartiles, outliers, and correlation,
and used chatgpt for more indepth explanation of concepts and certain code that I labeled in my script.
